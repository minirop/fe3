# List of strings

The characters used in those lists have a few differences from the dialogues. \ First, all characters are one under their dialogue counterpart. `あ` is `0x01` is a dialogue, but `0x00` in a list. \
Some characters are different, like `0xC4` being a space in a dialogue, but `ー` in a list. \
And last, books' numerotation use wrong kanjis (`騎1女` instead of `第1部`), so either the kanji list is really a different one, or they changed some characterw and this is an oversight.
