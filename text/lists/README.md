# List of strings

The characters used in those lists have a few differences from the dialogues. \
First, all characters are one under their dialogue counterpart. \
Some characters are different, like `0xC4` being a space in a dialogue, but `ー` in a list. \
And last, books' numerotation use wrong kanjis (`騎1女` instead of `第1部`), so either the kanji list is really a different one, or they changed some characters and this is an oversight.

`シーダ` (Ceada) in a dialogue is `5C B9 88` but is `5B 00 C3 00 87 00` in the characters' names list.
