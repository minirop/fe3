# Fire Emblem: Monshō no Nazo

This is a disassembly of Fire Emblem: Monshō no Nazo, also known as Fire Emblem: Mystery of the Emblem. It is the third installment in the Fire Emblem series.

It builds the following ROM:

- **fe3.sfc** `sha1: 3ee8cbe6638da64f1d91df9b81b1478498a5999f`

## Setting up

You need to have `wla-65816` and `wlalink` from [wla-dx](https://github.com/vhelin/wla-dx), and `make` in your PATH. (`sha1sum` too if you want to check the generated ROM is correct)

## Building

Just type `make`.

## Help needed

If someone wants to tackle writing a compressor. The decompressor is the first loop of `extract_graphics` from [fe3-png](https://github.com/minirop/fe3-png/).
